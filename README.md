## What I learned
In this project I became far more comfortable with JDBC and using prepared statements to help protect against SQL injection. Testing my SQL statements in the shell was very helpful to make sure I am getting the correct data, as well as writing my statements in the order FROM, JOIN ON, LIKE/WHERE then SELECT. Ordering that way helps me break it down piece by piece vs trying to produce the statement as a whole.
